The goal of qfieldcloudR is to provide a set of helper functions for interacting with the QFieldCloud API including querying projects, retrieving data, and user management. 

It can be used for accessing QFieldCloud data for programmatic analysis with spatial packages such as `sf` within R or to build web apps that support user interaction with QFieldCloud via `Shiny`.

Find more information about [QFieldCloud](https://github.com/opengisch/qfieldcloud) and the [QFieldCloud API docs](https://app.qfield.cloud/swagger/).
